# User Status Implementation

## Overview
This document explains how the user status functionality was implemented in the application. The status column allows administrators to mark users as "active", "suspended", or "deleted" through the admin panel.

## Problem Solved
Previously, the User Management functionality in the admin panel was attempting to update a 'status' column that didn't exist in the users table, resulting in errors like:

```
Error deleting user: {code: 'PGRST204', details: null, hint: null, message: "Could not find the 'status' column of 'users' in the schema cache"}
```

## Solution
We implemented the following solution:

1. Verified the existence of the 'status' column in the users table using a check script
2. Created a migration script (`supabase/migrations/20230501_add_user_status.sql`) to add the status column if needed
3. Implemented status verification and update tools (`check_user_status.js`)
4. Updated the user management code to properly use the status column

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/admin/UserManagement.js`
  - Fixed `handleDeleteUser()` to properly mark users as deleted
  - Updated `handleStatusChange()` to use the status column
  - Fixed `handleBulkStatusChange()` to perform bulk status updates

## Status Values
The status column supports three values:
- `active` - Normal user account (default)
- `suspended` - Temporarily disabled account
- `deleted` - Soft-deleted account

## Testing
The status column functionality has been tested and works for:
- Updating a single user's status
- Bulk updating multiple users' statuses
- Marking users as deleted

## Using the Status in Other Parts of the App
To use the status elsewhere in the app, you can query it from the users table:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('id, name, email, status')
  .eq('status', 'active'); // Filter for active users only
```

You can also add RLS policies based on status, such as:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Only show active users" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (status = 'active');
```
