# Messaging System Design Plan

## System Overview
We're developing a real-time messaging system for a student marketplace platform that enables direct communication between buyers and sellers. The core goals are:

1. Enable seamless communication about listings
2. Provide reliable message delivery with read receipts
3. Support attachments for product details
4. Maintain conversation history
5. Enable notifications for new messages

## User Roles and Flows

### User Roles
- **Buyers**: Browse listings, initiate conversations, send inquiries
- **Sellers**: Respond to inquiries, provide additional information
- **Administrators**: Monitor conversation metrics, handle reports

### Key User Flows
1. **Listing Inquiry**:
   - Buyer views listing
   - Buyer initiates conversation with seller
   - Seller receives notification
   - Conversation thread established

2. **Ongoing Communication**:
   - Users exchange messages in existing threads
   - Users receive notifications for new messages
   - Users can see when messages are read

3. **Listing-Related Actions**:
   - Negotiate prices through messages
   - Share additional images/attachments
   - Link to listing directly in conversation

## Features & Requirements

### Must-Have Features
- Real-time message exchange
- Conversation threading by listing
- Read receipts
- Image/file attachments
- Typing indicators
- Offline message queueing
- Push notifications
- Conversation history

### Optional Enhancements
- Rich text formatting
- Voice messages
- Location sharing
- Message reactions/emojis
- Message search
- Message forwarding
- Group conversations (for multi-party negotiations)

### Technical Constraints
- Must work across web and mobile interfaces
- Must handle intermittent connectivity
- Must scale to thousands of concurrent users
- Must comply with data privacy regulations
- Must support message retention policies

## Architecture Design

### High-Level Components
1. **Frontend Layer**:
   - Web client (React)
   - Mobile client (React Native)
   - Real-time connection manager
   - Message composition/rendering components
   - Notification handler

2. **Backend Layer**:
   - Authentication service
   - Message routing service
   - Presence service (online/offline status)
   - Notification service
   - Storage service (for attachments)

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Message database (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
   - File storage (Supabase Storage)
   - Caching layer (for active conversations)

4. **Communication Layer**:
   - WebSocket server (for real-time)
   - REST API (for CRUD operations)
   - Push notification gateways

## Data Models

### Conversation
```
{
  id: UUID,
  created_at: Timestamp,
  updated_at: Timestamp,
  listing_id: UUID (optional, when tied to a listing),
  metadata: {
    title: String,
    last_activity: Timestamp
  }
}
```

### Conversation Participant
```
{
  id: UUID,
  conversation_id: UUID,
  user_id: UUID,
  joined_at: Timestamp,
  role: String (buyer/seller),
  last_read_message_id: UUID,
  notifications_enabled: Boolean
}
```

### Message
```
{
  id: UUID,
  conversation_id: UUID,
  sender_id: UUID,
  content: String,
  created_at: Timestamp,
  status: String (sending/sent/delivered/read/failed),
  reply_to_id: UUID (optional),
  has_attachments: Boolean
}
```

### Message Attachment
```
{
  id: UUID,
  message_id: UUID,
  type: String (image/file/etc),
  url: String,
  filename: String,
  size: Number,
  metadata: Object
}
```

## Tech Stack Recommendations

### Frontend
- **React/React Native**: Unified experience across platforms
- **Supabase Realtime**: For WebSocket connections and real-time updates
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: For consistent UI components
- **React Query**: For data fetching, caching, and state management

### Backend
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-service with built-in auth, storage, and realtime capabilities
- **PostgreSQL**: For relational data storage with powerful querying
- **Edge Functions**: For custom APIs and notification handling

### Why This Stack?
- Leverages existing Supabase infrastructure
- Provides built-in real-time capabilities
- Simplifies auth integration
- Offers good scaling options
- Reduces operational complexity

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Implement message sharding by conversation ID
- Use separate read/write paths for high-volume operations
- Cache active conversations for faster access

### Performance Optimization
- Paginate message history loads
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Use compression for message content
- Throttle frequent events (typing indicators)

### Load Management
- Implement backpressure mechanisms
- Rate-limit message sends per user
- Degrade gracefully under heavy load

## Security & Privacy

### Message Security
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Secure file uploads with signed URLs
- Message expiration policies for sensitive content

### Authentication & Authorization
- Verify user identity for each message
- Validate permissions per conversation
- Prevent unauthorized access to conversations

### Privacy Controls
- Allow users to delete messages
- Support conversation muting/blocking
- Implement data retention policies

## Failure Handling

### Network Failures
- Queue messages locally during disconnection
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Display connection status to users

### Service Failures
- Implement circuit breakers for dependent services
- Use persistent storage for critical message queues
- Provide clear error messages with recovery options

### Data Integrity
- Validate messages before persistence
- Implement idempotent message processing
- Use transaction guarantees for critical operations

## Deployment & Monitoring Plan

### Deployment Strategy
- Feature flagging for incremental rollout
- A/B testing for UI changes
- Canary deployments for backend changes

### Monitoring
- Track message delivery rates and latency
- Monitor WebSocket connection health
- Set alerts for abnormal patterns
- Track user engagement metrics

### Observability
- Implement structured logging
- Create dashboards for system health
- Trace message flow through the system
